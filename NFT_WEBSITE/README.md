### Troubleshooting 

I installed the template on two different computers to test it and I didn't have any problems running it.

The only thing that I noticed is the following:

Sometimes when you install the template and run it on localhost:3000, React keeps reloading the website a couple of times. This usually goes away on its own after a few minutes. 

By the way, this is not a major problem because after you deploy the website using your custom domain using AWS amplify or any other service, this reloading goes away and doesn't really matter anymore. 

To see how to deploy your website using a custom domain on AWS, watch the following video ðŸ‘‡
